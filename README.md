# Aptos Void Screamer

Aptos is so fast, most people never hear the bodies hit the floor.

This script listens for the rarest sound in crypto:  
a **failed** transfer of more than $100M+ equivalent.

When someone tries to move an obscene amount of APT and the VM says *"no"* —  
the void itself screams.

You don’t get an alert.  
You get an autopsy.

- Wallet too fat for its own gas  
- Sequence number from the future  
- Pure hubris colliding with Move prover  
- The sound of a whale learning humility at 160k TPS
